# Question
What is event delegation?

# Answer
First, Event ***Propogation*** is how the information of an event occuring is distributed from a child element all the way up to the elements holding said child element (parent elements). Think of the information traveling up the node tree as if you were shouting upwards on a level in dante's inferno. Each time you shout, your voice travels all the way up to the first level, from the level you're shouting in. This indicates that the information is being received by parent elements and grandparent elements alike.

```html
<!-- (3.) All the way up to the Indifferent -->
<div id="grandparentElement">

    <!-- (2.) Up to Limbo -->
    <p id="parentElement">


        <!-- (1.) Shouting from the Lustful -->
        <img id="childElement" class="sillyImage">

    </p>

</div>
```

In this example, if the user decided to interact with the image inside of the paragraph element, the information about the user's interaction with the image would originally pop up in the image (child) element, spread up to the paragraph (parent) element, and then make its way up to the div (grandparent) element. If the user were to interact with the parent element(s), the information would only travel upwards, not down to the child element. 

Because of this behavior, event delegation is made possible. Instead of making the image element handle all the information and responsibilities to respond (using script from another file), you can have the parent elements handle said information. You are *delegating* responsibility of information in this case, to a parent element, using its access to the child elements.
