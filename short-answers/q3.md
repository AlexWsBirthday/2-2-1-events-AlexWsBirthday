# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer
Event delegation allows devs to address multiple child elements within one parent element, which wouldn't overload files with code addressing each and every child element's information. Rather than having an addEventListener for each and every child element, you have one for the parent element to capture information about all of the child elements. This delegation creates pockets of organized information that is easier to manage.
